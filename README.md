# Taleb Aphorisms

A simple emailer with aphorisms from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

To use it's pretty straigtforward:

1. Clone the repo.
2. (Optional but recommended) [Create a python3 virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your own `emails.txt` with a destination email on each line
5. Set up a crontab or whatever else you want

I made this for myself so if it works for me I'm satisfied. If you have problems, I may help you and I may not. Google will always help you, so I recommend you go there if you have problems.
